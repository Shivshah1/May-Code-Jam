This project, led by Shivang Shah, Su Wai, and Malcolm Barnes, analyzed exercise data to identify which types of exercises, machines, and equipment are most effective for 
individuals starting their fitness journey. The goal was to provide insights on workout effectiveness and suitability for beginners.

We found that intermediate-level workouts offered the greatest variety and challenge, providing a balanced mix of exercise types and difficulty to support continued fitness 
development. Our analysis also revealed that lower body exercises burned the most calories overall, making them a key focus for efficient workouts.

Another key insight was that barbells stood out as the most versatile equipment, offering access to a wide range of high-impact exercises, making them the most likely piece of 
equipment customers would be inclined to purchase.
